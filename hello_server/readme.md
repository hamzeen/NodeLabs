Running this example..

1. make sure node js is installed
2. go to terminal/cmd prompt and navigate to this folder/dir
3. hit the following on terminal/cmd
  node hello_server

4. Now the worlds tiniest web server is running at:
  http://localhost:3000/

5. Navigate to above url on your favorite browser & you should be greeted with
  "Hello Simple Server"
